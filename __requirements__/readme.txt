I would like to use google maps API to calculate the distance between a list of addresses.

Each day displays total KM driven for that day.

I am a contractor that uses my personal vehicle. I have an excel document with a list of addresses from the past 3 years that I need to calculate the total KM driven (for CRA/tax purposes).
